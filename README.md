# Maintaining-Script-Fedora

## Run Script
You can try this script by running the following commands:

```sh
bash maintaining.sh
```

or

```sh
chmod +x maintaining.sh
./maintaining.sh
```

## Dialog Script
Recently, added the same script with a CLI Dialog, to make it more appealing. The steps to run it are the same as the ones above.

```sh
bash maintaining.sh
```
